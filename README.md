The purpose of this project is to analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on the stock market by utilizing data from 20 different stocks across four distinct categories. The dataset encompasses months leading up to and during the initial pandemic lockdowns, offering a visual representation of the market's transformation from pre-lockdown "normality" to its subsequent state during the pandemic.
