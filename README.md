The purpose of the following project was to take multiple data sets from a total of 20 stocks in the stock market. The data was picked from four different categories to see how the pandemic affected the stock market through multiple categories. This diversity of data provides an amazing insight to how the lockdown due to covid 19 affected a variety of stocks. In a time where many people were uncertain or believed the market would crash any day. The data includes months prior to the lockdown just to visually show the difference from before to after the lockdown. This gives us an idea of what the stock market was like before in a time of "normality".
