The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market by utilizing data from 20 different stocks across four distinct categories. The dataset encompasses months leading up to the lockdown, offering a visual representation of the market's transformation from pre-lockdown "normality" to its subsequent state during the pandemic.
